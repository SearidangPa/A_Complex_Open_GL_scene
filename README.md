I build my code on top of the framework provided by the University of Nottingham. Link: 
[here](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxwowa/framework/documentation).

In this project, I implemented a scene in OpenGL using techniques accumulated throughout the semester such as hierarchical modeling, texture mapping, sprite-sheet animation, skybox environment, lighting, viewing, and surface subdivision. The scene is a robot walking to a bus stop in a city. The program lets the user change the perspective, the lighting and the movement of the robots. For more details, see "Report.pdf".
